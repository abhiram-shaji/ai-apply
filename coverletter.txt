I’m writing to express my deep interest in contributing to your team. With a strong foundation in full-stack development, a diverse portfolio (www.worksofabhiram.com), and hands-on experience across startups and global firms like Deloitte, I bring technical excellence and creative problem-solving to the table.

I won’t mince words—I've been struggling to find a meaningful opportunity where I can truly demonstrate what I’m capable of. It's taken a toll on my mental health, but I remain driven and passionate about what I do. I know I’m talented, and I’m confident that if given the chance, I will be one of the best hires you'll ever make.

I’m eager to bring value, learn quickly, and prove myself through action. I hope to hear from you and would be grateful for the opportunity to talk further.
